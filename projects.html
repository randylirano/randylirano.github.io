                <h6>Application Manager</h6>
                <h6>June 2021 – August 2021</h6>
                <p>I built an application that manages job applications received by a single company. I used a dummy database to test the functionality of the application. The application was developed using a relational database, then replaced using document database to reduce linking. As a final step of the development, an in-memory database was added.</p>

                <h6>ChatBot with Recipe</h6>
                <h6>April 2021 – May 2021</h6>
                <p>This is a group project where we built a chatbot that responds to a recipe request and a general conversation. The chatbot was incorporated using neural network model and rule-based model to provide a response. A GUI was used to takes the user’s input and decides the appropriate model to call for a response.</p>

                <h6>Face Mask Detection</h6>
                <h6>March 2021 – April 2021</h6>
                <p>The purpose of the project is to demonstrate the practice of software engineering principles in a group environment. Insipired by some challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, this web based application could detect when a person is properly wearing a mask. I participated in the web development team where I developed a web structure that will serve as the platform for our AI-based face mask detection model. To keep all the commits organized and reduce risk of accidental overwrite, we designate 2 people to review every merge request. I was the reviewer from the web development team, working together with one more reviewer from the backend team to review every merge request.</p>
